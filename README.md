# First steps

Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against us.

And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,
for ever and ever.

Amen.

What is the matrix that we live within?

What is its true nature?

How do we best interact with it, and it with us?

Do we want to unplug? We don't have to.  The choice is ours. Truth or chaos. Let's discover reality together.

We need each other.
